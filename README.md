To use the program, locate the 'main' method, nearly at the end of the program, and uncomment the figure you want to display. By default, you will see:

def main():  
    fig1()  
\##    fig2()  
\##    fig3()  
\##    fig4()  
\##    fig5()  
\##    fig6()  
\##    fig7()  
\##    fig8()  
\##    fig9()  
\##    fig10()  
\##    fig11()  
\##    fig12()  
\##    fig13()  
\##    fig14()  

Which will display fig1. For example, to display fig7, comment out 'fig1()' and uncomment 'fig7()':

def main():  
\##    fig1()  
\##    fig2()  
\##    fig3()  
\##    fig4()  
\##    fig5()  
\##    fig6()  
    fig7()  
\##    fig8()  
\##    fig9()  
\##    fig10()  
\##    fig11()  
\##    fig12()  
\##    fig13()  
\##    fig14()  

Some figures may take time to display while others should appear almost immediately. The number of each method corresponds to the figure in the paper.
